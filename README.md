# Model-on-Breast-Cancer-Data
A breast cancer classification algorithm trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is available here. Breast tumours are classified as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using features collected from medical pictures, and this model is constructed using the Random Forest algorithm.

## Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used to train and evaluate the model. There are a total of 569 data points in the collection, all of which are digital breast imaging samples with associated feature data.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The model is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library. It follows the typical machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, splitting into training and testing sets, feature scaling, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## Files
â€¢	Imanat_Model_v1.ipynb(located in master branch): Python script file containing the code for the initial machine learning model based on a specific algorithm.
â€¢	Imanat_Model_v2.ipynb(loacted in new-master branch): Python script file containing an updated machine learning model using a different algorithm or approach.

## Instructions
1.	Clone the repository.
2.	Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3.	Run or execute Imanat_Model_v1.ipynb and Imanat_Model_v2.ipynb using a Python interpreter.
4.	Follow the instructions within the notebook or script to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
5.	Experiment with different models, hyperparameters, or feature engineering techniques to improve the classification results.
Feel free to modify and extend the code to fit your specific requirements or explore different aspects of breast cancer classification.
